# Car-Coupons
Customer coupon acceptance rates

**Assignment notebook:** [https://github.com/ryanmw99/Car-Coupons/blob/main/prompt.ipynb ](https://github.com/ryanmw99/Car-Coupons/blob/main/prompt.ipynb)

## What is the problem?
This project aims to understand differences between customers who accept the diriving coupon and those who do not. 
It uses explorartory data analysis, statistical summarization, and data visilualiztion to discern some findings. 

## What is the data?
This data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechinical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. There are three possible answers people can choose from:

- **"Right away"**
- **"Later, before the coupon expires"**
- **"No, I do not want the coupon"**


## What are the findings?

## What do I recommend?

_**This shows that bar-goers are a good target audience for our program.**_

## Independent Investigations


### Investigating Destination / Direction of Travel
 

**Hypothesis: _Could it be that redemption rate is impacted by the destination and direction of travel for different coupon types?_**



**Observations when comparing home versus work as a destination**



**Observations when comparing the directionality towards or away from the coupon redemption site**



**Observations when the destination is 'No Urgent Place'**




### Investigating Time of Day

 

**Hypothesis: _Does the Time of Day have an effect on redeeming the coupons?_**



## Actionable Learnings & Recommendations

**Patterns to exploit**


**Missed opportunities**

**Overal Product Recommendations**
