# Car-Coupons
Customer coupon acceptance rates

**Assignment notebook:** [https://github.com/ryanmw99/Car-Coupons/blob/main/prompt.ipynb ](https://github.com/ryanmw99/Car-Coupons/blob/main/prompt.ipynb)

## What is the problem?
This project aims to understand differences between customers who accept the diriving coupon and those who do not. 
It uses explorartory data analysis, statistical summarization, and data visilualiztion to discern some findings. 

## What is the data?
This data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechinical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. There are three possible answers people can choose from:

- **"Right away"**
- **"Later, before the coupon expires"**
- **"No, I do not want the coupon"**


## What are the findings?
The findings show that the older and the more people that the people travel with the more likely they are to be paying customers that accept coupons. Additionally, those with income below 50k accept coupons at the highest rates. Meanwhile, those under 30 who visit establishments regularly do not accept coupons and their business can be relied upon. 
## What do I recommend?
That being said, if the coupons are marketed to the two extremes, then more will be accepted.
_**This shows that regular bar-goers are already invested and a good target audience are groups and low incomes.**_

## Independent Investigations

### Investigating Expensive Restuarants
**Hypothesis: _Could it be that redemption rate is affected by the type of restuarant and value of coupon they are going to?_**



**Observations when comparing home versus other as a destination**



**Observations when comparing having a friend, partner, or being alone in the car**



**Observations when the of the overall trends in their acceptances**



## Actionable Learnings & Recommendations

**Patterns to exploit**


**Missed opportunities**

**Overal Product Recommendations**
